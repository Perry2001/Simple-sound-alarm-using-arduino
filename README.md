# Simple Sound Alarm

This repository contains the source code and documentation for creating a simple sound alarm system using a sound sensor, Arduino, a speaker with an SD card module, an SD card, and jumper cables.

## Overview

This project is designed to create a sound alarm that monitors the ambient sound level using a sound sensor. If the sound level exceeds a certain threshold, the system will play a specific sound file stored on an SD card through a speaker.

The Arduino IDE is used for programming the Arduino board and managing the software logic of the sound alarm.

## Materials

To build this simple sound alarm system, you will need the following materials:

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Sound sensor
- Speaker with an SD card module
- SD card (with sound files)
- Jumper cables

## Arduino IDE

The Arduino IDE is used for programming the Arduino board. Make sure you have the IDE installed on your computer before starting the project. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from the official Arduino website: [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

## Repository Structure

- `src/` - Contains the Arduino sketch for the sound alarm system.

  ```cpp
  // Sample Arduino code snippet
  void setup() {
      // Initialize the sound sensor, speaker, and SD card module
  }

  void loop() {
      // Main loop logic to monitor sound levels and trigger alarms
  }
